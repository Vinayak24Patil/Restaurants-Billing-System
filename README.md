# Restaurants-Billing-System
 This repository contains a basic Restaurant Billing System . It includes two main classes: Bill and main. The Bill class manages billing functions, such as adding orders, quantities, and calculating total cost. The main class creates a Bill object, adds orders, and displays total. This project provides a foundation for further development.
